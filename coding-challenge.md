# Task Management System with Firebase Integration

**Objective:**
Your task is to implement a simple task management system integrated with Firebase. The system should allow users to perform basic operations such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, listing tasks, and removing tasks. Additionally, you will set up Firebase Functions to handle these operations as endpoints.

**Requirements:**

1. Set up a Firebase project from the Firebase console.
2. Create a Firebase Functions project.
3. Implement the following Firebase Functions:
    - `addTask`: Add a new task.
    - `listTasks`: Display a list of all tasks.
    - `completeTask`: Mark a task as completed.
    - `removeTask`: Remove a task.
4. Each task should have at least a title, description, and a status (completed or not completed).
5. Utilize Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database to persist tasks between application runs.
6. Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes in your code.
7. Ensure that the code is modular, readable, and follows best practices.
8. Write a workflow using a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions) to build and deploy Firebase Functions (+bonus).

**Submission:**

1. Create a public Git repository containing your code.
2. Include a README.md file with instructions on how to use and deploy your task management system.
3. Provide a brief explanation of your design decisions and any additional features implemented (if applicable).

**Note:**

- Aim to complete the challenge within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 1.5 - 2 hours).
- Prioritize code quality, functionality, and adherence to the specified requirements.
